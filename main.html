            <h2>Linear Regression</h2>
            <p> Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to model the relationship between an input variable (independent variable) and an output variable (dependent variable) by fitting a straight line to the data.<br><br>

              <b>Core Idea:</b>
                It assumes that the output changes at a constant rate with respect to the input. The model tries to find the best-fit line that minimizes the error between predicted and actual values.

            <h2> Decision Tree</h2>
            <p> A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It mimics human decision-making by breaking down complex problems into a series of simpler decisions, organized in a tree-like structure.

                Each internal node of the tree represents a decision rule based on a feature, each branch represents an outcome of that rule, and each leaf node represents a final prediction or class label.<br><br>
                
                 <b>Core Idea:</b>
                 The core idea of a decision tree is to split the dataset into subsets based on feature values that maximize information gain (or minimize impurity). This is done recursively until the tree reaches a stopping condition (like max depth or minimum samples per leaf).

            <h2>Classification</h2>
            <p> Classification is a supervised learning task where the goal is to predict a categorical label (e.g., spam vs. not spam, disease vs. no disease) based on input features. It’s one of the most common problems in machine learning.
                  <br><br><b>Core Idea:</b>
                  The model learns from labeled data to find patterns that separate classes. During prediction, it assigns a new input to one of the predefined categories.<br><br>

                    Binary classification: Two classes (e.g., yes/no).

                    Multiclass classification: More than two classes (e.g., digit recognition 0–9).

                    Multi-label classification: Each instance can belong to multiple classes
